W5HC Frameworkâ„¢

The W5HC Frameworkâ„¢ is a structured problem-solving and analysis methodology designed to simplify complex scenarios into clear, actionable insights.

It builds upon my earlier research with the W5H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) questioning technique, evolving it into a refined and practical framework with the addition of Change (C).

ðŸ”¹ Why W5HC?

In both cybersecurity and technical support, the ability to ask the right questions determines how fast and effectively an issue can be resolved. The W5HC Framework provides a systematic approach to break down challenges into manageable pieces:

Who â€“ identifies the user, customer, or system involved.

What â€“ defines the issue, symptom, or object of analysis.

When â€“ establishes the timeline, frequency, or trigger of the issue.

Where â€“ locates the environment, platform, or affected area.

Why â€“ uncovers the root cause, intention, or reasoning.

How â€“ explains the process, workflow, or technical mechanism.

Change (C) â€“ identifies what has changed (configurations, updates, behaviors, environment) that might have triggered or influenced the problem.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Cybersecurity investigations (phishing analysis, incident response, threat modeling)

Technical Support troubleshooting (structured questioning, root cause analysis, escalation clarity)

Business operations & decision-making

Research & academic training

Problem-solving workshops

ðŸ”¹ Benefits for Technical Support

Reduces time-to-resolution by ensuring no critical angle is missed

Creates consistency in troubleshooting across support teams

Improves communication with customers through structured questioning

Highlights changes that directly contribute to technical issues

Helps in documenting cases for knowledge base and escalation
